# TableTop-Simulator-Scripts
Lua scripts used in TableTop Simulator

## Overview

This is my first project in Lua. Built in 1 day.

This is a script used with the Deception game within Table Top Simulator. The purpose of this script 
it to automate all of the game setup. There are quite a few different decks and roles that have to be 
dealt and assigned. This does it all with the click of one button.
